================================================================================

It was the year AD 2101  -  War  was  beginning.  With unrestricted public cloud
storage access,  some unknown alien entity  set humanity up the bomb.  The world
was  being  reduced  to a barren  wasteland  one  city at a time as naive  users
executed files on their dropbox called "HOW_TO_MAKE_FREE_MONEY", which literally
forkbombed  their  computer,  as  tens of millions  of forks  were  beamed  into
existence  through any connected RS232 Matter  Transporters,  sent from  unknown
origins.

The severed head of Ryan Stiles,  the second ever President of Earth sits glumly
behind a desk in a bunker deep beneath earth's final bastion - Palmerston North.
The  severed head of  Ryan Stiles  takes a short  swig of his Pabst Blast!,  and
levels his eyes at the selection of military officials standing before him.

"Well, gentlemen, it's down to the river,  and damned if we've been dealt a hand
full of lemons. We've got one card left to play and we'd damned well better make
sure its an ace. What have you got for me?"

A thick  manila folder  slams down on the rich  mahogany desk,  stamped with the
word "confidential" in bold red letters.

"What, are you going to read Ellroy to me? Just tell me the damn plan!" exclaims
the severed head of Ryan Stiles, clearly unimpressed by the stack of paper.

"Mr President, Sir, it would be simply impossible to explain the matters covered
in these documents through spe-" begins a slick-haired scientist donning a suave
white lab coat.  Before he can  finish his  sentence,  The severed  head of Ryan
Stiles makes a subtle nodding motion to a burly  suited man standing beside him,
and the scientist is struck with a solid back-handed slap.  As he picks  himself
up from the  ground, wiping away a smear of  blood from the corner of his mouth,
the scientist explains the complex strategy of the plan.

"The strategy  involves the  clever  use  of  the  earth's current  position. It
appears  that in several days, it might be possible to launch a capsule and have
it  slingshot  around  several  planets,  while  constantly  accelerating.   The
documents  postulate that travelling at sufficient speed  through Jupiter,  with
current  atmospheric  conditions,  might  provide a  method of  transposing  the
space-time matrix, however slightly, onto itself..."

The scientist  pauses for a second, looking  expectantly at the severed  head of
Ryan Stiles, who stares back with a blank expression.

"Thereby effectively sending a single man back in time." finishes the Scientist.

The president purses his lips, "I see. That certainly enables a number of plans,
but there's no  way we can organise a mission  back in time in just a few  days,
especially accounting for the bureaucratic red-tape..."

"If I may, Sir..."

A  voice comes  from the  back of the  dim  bunker,  and  an incredibly handsome
uniformed  man steps forward out of  obscuring shadow  wearing a pair of classic
aviators,  holding a single thin manila  folder in one  hand and a burning cuban
cigar in the other.
He  lazily  tosses the  manila folder onto  the president's desk,  and  saunters
forward,  favoring one leg,  probably  because of a war  injury  obtained  while
single-handedly taking on a platoon of robot soldiers several years earlier.  As
he sits casually  on the corner of the president's desk,  taking  a long draw of
his cigar, he instantly commands the respect of everybody in the room because of
his totally bangin' badass attitude.

"We've had a plan for this scenario for quite some time... It turns out that the
cause of our planet's bad luck can be  attributed directly to the creation of an
ancient technology known as 'Dropbox' as a primary file storage platform..."

"It's decided, then!"  Announces the  severed  head of Ryan Stiles,  "We'll send
back a man to prevent Dropbox from ever being created!"

The scientist pipes up, "It would cause a paradox to send anybody  back to  undo
events in the past!"

"Sure, but we're not going to UNDO anything" says the badass-looking dude calmly,
"We've got  no  choice but to  create a  better  Peer-to-Peer  distributed  file
storage structure... For great justice."

"FOR GREAT JUSTICE!"  The words echo around the  bunker,  as they are  spoken by
everybody in unison, commanded by the dude's badass attitude.


                                      ---


Two  days later,  the handsome man  sits in the cockpit of a  super-cool looking
fighter pod on the runway at Palmerston North's domestic  airport. The pod has a
very aerodynamic appearance, and the letters "ZIG" stencilled on either side.

"The Zero Inertia Glider"  announces  a scientist,  standing on a  podium to the
side of the pod,  "Represents the  pinnacle  of over a century  of technological
evolution. Blood, sweat and tears have been poured into it's creation in volumes
greater  than anyone  could  have anticipated.  And  then of  course there's the
money..."

The scientist's joke is met with a babble of laughter from the seated crowd. The
dude in the cockpit taps his cigar on the lip  of the fighter and scans his eyes
across the various gauges and dials on the dashboard.

"As you all know,  we are here  today to  witness both humanity's  last hope and
the first ever mission back in time. Captain Owen will pilot the ZIG to the year
2012  and create a superior Peer-to-Peer distributed file  storage structure  to
prevent Dropbox from monopolising the market. In thirty minu-"

The scientists speech is cut off by a scream from the crowd. A woman is pointing
at the sky behind the podium. Following her finger,  the scientist turns to look
and gasps. "They're here!" he yells.

Instantly, the crowd breaks into a full-on panic. "You have no chance to survive
make your time!" screams a woman holding a baby above her head.

The scientist looks at Captain Owen sitting in the ZIG pod, "Take off every ZIG"
he says, saluting. "You know what you are doing."

Captain Owen  pulls the cockpit closed above his head and flicks a switch on the
dashboard in front of him,  firing up the engines.  "For great justice"  he says
through the intercom.

The scientist picks  up the severed head of Ryan Stiles and  holds him under his
right arm, and watches  as the ZIG  pod launches  into the distance.  He salutes
as a single tear rolls down his face.

"For great justice."

================================================================================

YOUR MISSION, SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT, IS TO CREATE A DISTRIBUTED FILE
STORAGE SYSTEM USING A PEER-TO-PEER NETWORK.

------------------------------SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS-------------------------------

 - THE SYSTEM SHOULD SUPPORT FILES OF ANY SIZE, THOUGH THE FILE NEED NOT EXIST
   IN ITS ENTIRITY ON A SINGLE NODE

 - FILES SHOULD BE REPLICATED SUCH THAT NODES MAY DISCONNECT WITHOUT WARNING
   (PERHAPS DUE TO BEING FORK BOMBED) WITHOUT LOSS OF DATA

 - FILES MUST HAVE OWNERSHIP AND PERMISSION ATTRIBUTES, SUCH THAT CONFIDENTIAL
   GOVERNMENT FILES MAY BE STORED SAFELY WITHOUT FEAR OF EXPOSURE

 - THERE SHOULD BE NO SINGLE POINTS OF FAILURE IN THE SYSTEM

 - LOOKUP TIMES NEED NOT BE OPTIMAL, SINCE NETWORK LATENCY IN YOUR TARGET
   CENTURY IS PROPORTIONALLY LARGE

================================================================================

PLEASE  CONSIDER THE USE OF THE FOLLOWING  PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES IN IMPLEMENTING
YOUR APPLICATION, SUCH AS TO NOT AROUSE SUSPICION BY USING A NEWER LANGUAGE FROM
THIS CENTURY.  MEDICAL AND  PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS  HAVE  DETERMINED THE  FOLLOWING
THREE LANGUAGES TO SUIT YOUR PROGRAMMING STYLE THE MOST CLOSELY.

--------------------------------------- C --------------------------------------

    RESEARCH SHOWS THAT C WAS THE MOST POPULAR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE* IN THE
    TIME THAT YOU ARE VISITING.

    HOWEVER, C++ OFFERS A GREATER FEATURE SET AND ACCESS TO MORE STRUCTURES
    AND LIBRARIES. THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE USE OF C IS AVOIDED
    FOR THIS MISSION (THOUGH IN GENERAL USAGE IS RECOMMENDED).

-------------------------------------- C++ -------------------------------------

    RESEARCH SHOWS THAT C++ WAS THE THIRD MOST POPULAR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE*
    IN THE TIME THAT YOU ARE VISITING.

    MANY LIBRARIES AND STRUCTURES EXIST FOR USAGE WITH C++, MAKING IT A GOOD
    CANDIDATE FOR USAGE IN THIS MISSION.


------------------------------------- JAVA -------------------------------------

    RESEARCH  SHOWS  THAT  JAVA  WAS THE  SECOND  MOST  POPULAR  PROGRAMMING
    LANGUAGE IN THE TIME THAT YOU ARE VISITING.

    A LARGE NUMBER OF LIBRARIES AND STRUCTURES EXIST FOR USE WITH JAVA, EVEN
    FOR  THE  SPECIFIC PURPOSES OF P2P OVERLAY NETWORKS AND DISTRIBUTED HASH
    TABLES. MOREOVER, THE QUIZ YOU TOOK IN TRAINING SHOWS THAT YOU ARE A ONE
    HUNDRED  PERCENT MATCH  FOR THIS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.  THE USE OF  THIS
    LANGUAGE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

================================================================================

PLEASE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TECHNOLOGIES FOR USE AS THE BASIS OF PEER-TO-PEER
OPERATION IN YOUR APPLICATION.

------------------------------------ CHORD -------------------------------------

    CHORD  IS ONE  OF THE FOUR  ORIGINAL DISTRIBUTED  HASH TABLE  PROTOCOLS,
    ALONG WITH CAN,  TAPESTRY, AND PASTRY.  IT WAS INTRODUCED IN 2001 BY ION
    STOICA,   ROBERT  MORRIS,   DAVID  KARGER,   FRANS  KAASHOEK,  AND  HARI
    BALAKRISHNAN, AND WAS DEVELOPED AT MIT.

    AN OPEN SOURCE LIBRARY IMPLEMENTING CHORD IN JAVA IS OPEN-CHORD
                      [http://open-chord.sourceforge.net/]

------------------------------------ PASTRY ------------------------------------

    PASTRY IS AN OVERLAY AND ROUTING NETWORK FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A DHT
    SIMILAR TO CHORD.

    THE ADVANTAGE OF PASTRY OVER CHORD IS THE ADDITION OF THE ROUTING SYSTEM
    ENABLING THE DHT TO  REDUCE DISTANCE  FROM A CLIENT FOR LOOKUP.  THIS IS
    ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT WHEN A FILESYSTEM IS CONSIDERED, SINCE THE CLIENT
    MIGHT HAVE TO TRANSFER A SIGNIFICANTLY SIZED FILE FROM THE HOSTING NODE.

    AN IMPLEMENTATION OF A FILESYSTEM BUILT ON PASTRY EXISTS, CALLED  "PAST"

    AN OPEN SOURCE LIBRARY IMPLEMENTING PASTRY IN JAVA IS FREEPASTRY
                    [http://www.freepastry.org/FreePastry/]

----------------------------------- KADEMLIA -----------------------------------

    KADEMLIA IS A DHT FOR  DECENTRALIZED P2P COMPUTER  NETWORKS DESIGNED  BY
    PETAR MAYMOUNKOV AND DAVID MAZIERES IN 2002.

    LIKE PASTRY,  KADEMLIA ROUTES  TOWARDS HOSTING  NODES BASED ON DISTANCE,
    THOUGH THE DISTANCE IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCLUSIVE OR OF THE NODES ID

    AN OPEN SOURCE LIBRARY IMPLEMENTING KADEMLIA IN JAVA IS OPENKAD
                      [http://code.google.com/p/openkad/]

================================================================================

 - Java will be used as it is my most proficient language.
 - Of Open-Chord, FreePastry and OpenKAD, FreePastry appears to provide the most
   easily-used API.
 - The advantages offered by Kademlia do not outweigh the complexity of OpenKAD.
