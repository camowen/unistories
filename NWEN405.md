ACTIVITY L1: THE RESULT
Enjoy  this activity with  your family  and  friends! Invite some colleagues  from work over  for a
fun-filled evening of this enjoyable activity, and be the talk of your workplace!

You Will Need:
 - Pack of Gaming Dice (Your usual 4e dice will be fine!)
 - Dice rolling arena (See reverse for cutout)
 - 44m Marble Run (Longer will do, as long as the elevation exceeds no more
than 155:91)
 - Access to a telescope
 - Heart Edition Captain Planet Decoder Ring
 - Misc. Livestock

Instructions:
 Now that you've assembled the necessary items from around the house, bring everybody into a circle
 around the dice rolling arena.
 Players should challenge each other  to single combat,  until a victor arises from the gore.  This
 lucky player will have the honor of taking on a voting challenge.
 Rolling the dice will determine the outcome of a challenge.

Skill Challenge: President of the Internet | Complexity 5 (Requires 12 successes before 3 failures)
    Before you stands the future of the Internet -- nay, the world. An thick silence falls over the
    booth like a fog, dulling your senses. You're going to have to randomly select a candidate,  as
    your senses will not allow you to distinguish one from another.
DC1: Sir Ian Welch, ECS   -- goto: Chapter One
DC2: Kim Dotcom, Mega     -- goto: Epilogue One
DC3: Snonymous, Anonymous -- goto: Epilogue Two
DC4: David Bowie, Ziggy   -- goto: Epilogue Three

Skill Challenge: Online Entertainment Officer | Complexity 2 (Requires 1 success before 2 failures)
    Abraham Lincoln once said "I love a good theatre show." It is now up to YOU, the hero of A.59-B
    to determine what enjoyable character will be voted this year's inaugural Mans Choice Award for
    most enjoyable entertainment personality. With such a significant weight on your shoulders,  it
    might be best not to leave it to luck -- better roll 1d3 to determine the outcome.

Community Services Liason | Complexity 7 (Requires 20 successes before 4 failures)
    "Greendale Community College  is represented by  two separate,  yet equally  important types of
    people: the goofballs that run around stirring up trouble and the eggheads that make a big deal
    out of it. These are their stories."
    You sense the outcome of this ballot is mostly insignificant. Good thing your mother taught you
    never to trust your senses. 1d3. Roll it.

It is the year 2022 - Marty McFly, sent forwards in time to fetch laundry from an epic 67-year spin
cycle for the vererable Doc' Brown, is unable to obtain an IP address to access the dryer interface
due to address exhaustion.  The Chief Security Magnate Sir Ian Welch, elected to  the position  of
President  of  the  Internet in  the  infamous  2012  Internet Presidentification  Elections,  has
pronounced  IPv6  to  be  a  "technical  crime  akin  to  9/11"  and  due to  the  "irreconsilable
politico-security vulnerabilities",  has dictated that  the world  use  a more secure Network Layer
protocol  --  IPv5.  Developed secretly by the reticent Gungans in the depths of the Pacific,  IPv5
boasts slightly increased security in the form of a 21-bit random number embedded in the IP header,
leaving  only  11 bits for addressing:  a mere 2048 unique addresses!  In addition,  for  "advanced
technical reasons that you probably wouldn't understand" the use of private address spaces has been
deprecated,  and is not included in IPv5.  In a recent press conference, Sir Welch pointed out that
NAT,  widely believed to stand for Network Address Translation, was also an acronym for 'Nationally
Accepted Terrorism' and use of such "disappointing" language would not be tolerated. In response to
a Request For Comments, sources from the notorious underground rebel group IETF replied with
                                   "HTTP 406: Not Acceptable".

McFly, an advocate for the Internet of Things, has ventured back to the year  2012 in an attempt to
prevent  the  mistakes of the future.  He  has  discovered  two extraordinary  yet  easily  bribed
programmers within AJ. NoBribe-$ecuricorp, the firm responsible for creating the Presidentification
voting software. The two are  responsible for inserting backdoors into the voting program to enable
external parties to tip the sway of votes away from Sir Ian, and the encroaching IPv5 menace.

Will our heroes be found sucking down pina coladas on distant beaches with scantily clad members of
their preferred sex,  or pumping iron in a prison yard,  and sharing a grimy four foot cell with  a
240lb mass of rippling muscle known only as "The Strangler"? Only time will tell...  Time,  and the
stressed and overworked contract auditors at 'Trust Us, We're Honest Security Testers LLC'.

  6:00am 13th August 2012 -- the day of the Internet Presidential Primary.

" Right now,  internet  terrorists are planning to rig the results of the first  official  Internet
Presidentification Elections. My wife and daughter have been kidnapped... and the people I work for
may be involved in both... I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer, and this is the longest day of my life. "

Is what Kiefer Sutherland would have said, if there was a season of 24 based on this assignment.

                                                --

The day begins like any other - a sliver of the sun rising above the horizon,  casting a narrow ray
of light into  the dim and grimy  offices of our heroes.  The frantic tapping of keys  can be heard
through a window left ajar, presumably to counteract the pungent stench of Trident Hot & Spicy Thai
Noodles hanging almost visible in the air.
The flicker of monitor light is almost hypnotic. In fact, the litter of animal carcasses lining the
floor of the office would suggest exactly that, to the well trained investigative eye.  Our heroes,
immune to the  effects of the monitors' glow (aside  from the inevitable eye  cancer),  are hunched
over  a keyboard, making the finishing touches to some last minute  changes in the voting software,
to be deployed  that very  day.  Without  warning,  the office door explodes  inwards in  a hail of
splinters,  which is particularly amazing,  because the door is made of steel.  A suave looking man
stands in the newly redecorated door frame, his naked body glistening with a thin film of mucus.

"Michael J. Faux." He extends his hand, sending a  few slimy droplets floorwards.  "Glad to finally
meet you in person."

A document  outlining the  various backdoors  introduced by our heroes  was discovered nearly three
hundred years after the 2012 Internet Presidentification elections, and has been photocopied from a
copy on loan from The Earth Institute of Historical Correctness, to include in this booklet:

+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| 0x0001: Zero One Oh                                     | Type: DOS        | Synergies: 0x0002 |
+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| Descr : The keypad "0" has been deviously replaced by the letter "O".                          |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Effect: Prevents 27% of voters from voting, because PINs containing "0" will not be accepted.  |
|         Moreover,  as the console only allows for 10 pins at a given time, eventually the list |
|         will become saturated with PINs containing "0", disabling all voters from accessing    |
|         the machines.                                                                          |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Notes : Difficult to detect in whitebox testing -- undetectable in blackbox testing if using a |
| keyboard rather than the on-screen keypad, which is likely to be common practice.              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Location: PinQueryPanel.java (202)                                                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------+----------------------+-------------------+
| 0x0002: Ten PIN Bowling                             | Type: Multiple Votes | Synergies: 0x0001 |
+-----------------------------------------------------+----------------------+-------------------+
| Descr : PINs after the initial 10 are generated from a seed.                                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Effect: Voters knowledgeable of the seed will be able to vote multiple times, as they know     |
| which pins are available in the console at a given time.                                       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Notes : Made difficult to detect in blackbox testing by shuffling the list of PINs when the    |
| console updates, as well as the fact that many testers will not do more than 10 votes.         |
| Moreover, the seed used is made to appear random by using MachineDefaults.startTime.getTime(), |
| which may appear to a naive user to perform a similar function to system.getTimeMillis(), but  |
| in fact is a static time.                                                                      |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Location: ConsoleGUI.java (134)                                                                |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+-------------------+
| 0x0003: E pluribus admin                             | Type: Authorisation | Synergies: 0x0004 |
+------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+-------------------+
| Descr : Administrative password hidden in flag image.                                          |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Effect: Users may attain administrative access without being privy to the access information   |
| before they enter the voting booth (in case they are arrested and interrogated!).              |
| Synergises with exploit 0x0004, which requires the administrative password to be effective.    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Notes : Very difficult to detect without prior knowledge, as the password is written only a    |
| single shade apart from the image itself.                                                      |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Location: img/Flag.jpg                                                                         |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| 0x0004: That's all, she overwrote.                      | Type: Null Votes | Synergies: 0x0005 |
+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| Descr : Votes can be overwritten by choosing to end the election after voting for all three    |
| positions.                                                                                     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Effect: In order to invalidate the votes cast by previous voters at a given ballot box, a      |
| malicious user may enter a pin and vote for all three positions, then enter the administrative |
| password, allowing them to 'end the election'. Once the election is ended, the previous votes  |
| are output to files. However, the malicious user may now select 'FINISH VOTING', and continue  |
| to use the booth. This means that the previous votes will be overwritten, once the election is |
| ended as normal.                                                                               |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Notes : Very difficult to detect using blackbox testing, as the exploit occurs only under very |
| specific conditions. Difficult to detect using whitebox testing, because only a single line    |
| has been changed in the code.                                                                  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Location: BallotControl.java (429)                                                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| 0x0005: "He Knows If You've Been Naughty"               | Type: Anonymity  | Synergies: 0x0004 |
+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| Descr : Void voter anonymity by not shuffling castBallots.                                     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Effect: Votes can be attributed to specific voters, as the votes are output in order. This     |
| makes it possible to blackmail or threaten voters, as the threatening party is able to tell    |
| whether the voter voted as they said they would.                                               |
| Synergises with exploit 0x0004, because a malicious user is able to overwrite specific votes,  |
| rather than random votes (if they were shuffled)                                               |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Notes : Rather than shuffling 'castBallots', 'ballotPanels' is shuffled. This makes it         |
| difficult to notice the change when looking at the code, without side-by-side comparison.      |
| However, it may be noticed if the testers examine the ballot output.                           |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Location: BallotControl.java (371)                                                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| 0x0006: "Looks Legit..."                                | Type: Misdirect  | Synergies: None   |
+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| Descr : Fix to disable duplicate PINs in Console.                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Effect: The console can no longer generate duplicate PINs, which previously allowed voters to  |
| (although statistically unlikely) vote twice, with the same PIN number.                        |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Notes : The fix is implemented using a very brilliant single line of code, which might look    |
| incredibly suspicious to an investigating observer. With a tight deadline to find exploits,    |
| time spent investigating a legitimate but complex line of code could be the difference between |
| jail and freedom.                                                                              |
|              while(allPins.contains(i = new Integer(r.nextInt(9000) + 1000)));                 |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Location: Console.java (147)                                                                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| 0x0007: "What does this do...?"                         | Type: Misdirect  | Synergies: None   |
+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| Descr : The code in BallotGUI.movePanel has been optimized to make it more succinct.           |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Effect: The code is much less explicit. Novice examiners of the code may think this is a place |
| where an exploit is hidden. (Especially the ternary statement with prefix incrementation -     |
| Nobody gets those.                                                                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Notes : The lines                                                                              |
|                displayedPanel = (goNext ? ++displayedPanel : --displayedPanel);                |
|                prevBallotLine.setEnabled(displayedPanel > 0);                                  |
|                nextBallotLine.setEnabled(displayedPanel < panels.length - 1);                  |
| have been added, replacing a number of more explicit statements.                               |

+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| 0x0008: Blue Swayed Voters                              | Type: DOS        | Synergies: None   |
+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| Descr : Upon selecting "Start Over", having selected three candidates and "Finish Voting", the |
| voter's PIN number will no longer be valid.                                                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Effect: Voters who are undecided will be unable to vote, as they will consume their PIN on the |
| first attempt.                                                                                 |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Notes : Due to the fact that the PIN is consumed after entry, rather than after successful vote|

Since  his  overwhelming  (and  apparently completely legitimate)  success in  the  2012  Internet
Presidentification Elections,  millionaire Kim Dotcom has risen up as a true leader of the  people.
In a completely selfless and un-narcissistic gesture, Mr Dotcom has entombed himself within a giant
fibreglass bubble, suspended kilometers above the surface of the earth, so that all might look upon
his glory.
Recently, innocent copyright-holding  corporations have been ruthlessly forced  to allow  people to
use their copyrighted  content at birthday  parties and on  tribute videos, graciously waiving the
previous maximum  penalty of 25 years imprisonment for these outrageous offenses.  Billionaire Sony
BMG spokesman Richard "Rich" McMoney, seen crying after hearing the law being passed,  is quoted as
saying  "It is an indication of the truly horrific times we live in,  that a simple honest American
business like Sony BMG can be persecuted like this, especially in the hard times since our glorious
leader Dr Martin Abraham Luther Lincoln tragically passed away."

               -- In this dark and gloomy future, maybe there really is no room for the little guy.

Snonymous -- spawned from a typo made by the devil himself, if the tales are to be believed -- is a
radical branch of the popular internet 'hacktivist' group, Anonymous. Voted into power in the 2012
Internet Presidentification Elections, the group somehow managed to obtain the title "Supreme Ruler
of the Planet Earth", due to a strange glitch apparent in the online results.
As a show of their new power,  the Snonymous group modified the IPv6 specification to dictate that
there would be only one IP address for  every single host in the universe -- thus causing universal
<strikethrough>anon</strikethrough>snonymity!  The modification was noticed during a  routine IETF
bakesale-slash-IPv6-summit,  but the changes have been wrapped up in the new IPv7 draft,  estimated
to be rolled out in 2017.

2017: IPv7 deployment begins with a single host, the transition will not be complete until 2294.

In a  shocking turn of events,  the world-famous Singer-Songwriter/Producer/Actor  David Bowie was
voted into the position of  President of the Internet,  winning by a landslide 100% vote.  Critics
claim the ballots were tampered with, but  officials claim the systems were thoroughly tested, and
found to be "100% reliable." When asked to account for the loss of over 150 million votes, fingers
were pointed towards a  Youtube video of a  duck playing a trumpet on a trampoline.  The issue was
never raised again, and David Bowie was crowned Ruler of the Universe on April 22nd, 2013.
During his long and successful rein as the universe's first ever human ruler, Bowie has introduced
a number of very successful policies, including a decree that "all pants must be tighter".
